					Hello, my name is Matthew Decker i'm enrolled in the interactive media design program at fanshawe college. I have always had a love for creating things so when i stumbled apon programs like photoshop and illustrator it was awesome to be able to take my inspirations into those programs and create something awesome. I also have a love for music, There is no other art form that can truley make you feel something like music does.I have messed around with making my own using FL Studios,and have even uploaded some EP's to Soundcloud. This coarse is very exciting, I have always wanted to learn code and learn how to to design websites. I love this field and am looking forward to learning lots for this program.
